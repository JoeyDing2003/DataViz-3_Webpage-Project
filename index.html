                                   <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                    <h3>1. Young Thousand Talents Program</h3> 
                                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                                        The National High-Level Overseas Talent Introduction Plan (referred to as the "Young Thousand Talents Program", aka YTT) is a program for introducing overseas talent to the People's Republic of China. Launched in December 2008, it is managed by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and implemented by the Central Talent Work Coordination Group. The plan focuses on China's strategic development goals and aims to attract high-level talent who have studied or worked abroad. On September 29, 2018, the review team for the Young Thousand Talents Program requested relevant units not to publicly mention the term "Thousand Talents Plan" due to concerns about the safety of overseas talent. On April 18, 2020, search results for the "Thousand Talents Plan" were blocked on search engines such as Baidu and Sogou, as well as on social networks like Weibo and WeChat in mainland China. In August 2023, Reuters reported that according to national and local policy documents, online job advertisements, and direct sources, the Young Thousand Talents Program has now been replaced by the "Qiming Plan" supervised by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>2. Research Background and Significance</h3>
                                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                                        From 2011 to 2017, over seven years, China issued 3,576 invitations to top scientists and researchers worldwide through the YTT program. Although this initiative demonstrates China's proactive stance in the global talent competition, there are still doubts about the program's effectiveness in actually attracting these top talents and enhancing their research productivity in China. Specifically, China's national research support projects, such as funding, research facilities, and policy incentives, can not only encourage foreign scientists and researchers to return to work in China but may also positively impact China's overall research productivity. Such support provides these top talents with the necessary resources and environment to drive innovation and breakthroughs in research.
                                        <br>&emsp; However, returnees may face challenges integrating into China's academic community after returning, which could affect their research output and innovation speed. Studies show that the widespread presence of administrative intervention and personal networks in academia may hinder the freedom and independence of returnees in scientific exploration, thereby slowing their research progress.
                                        <br>&emsp; Governments worldwide recognize that returnees play a key role in building globally competitive research institutions and promoting knowledge-based economic development. These talents not only bring international perspectives and advanced research methods but can also facilitate the cross-border flow of knowledge and technology through their international connections and experience, thereby enhancing national innovation and competitiveness.
                                        <br>&emsp; Therefore, the key question is: Are China's talent programs truly effective in recruiting top scientists and cultivating the productivity of returnee researchers? This involves not only the design and implementation of talent programs but also how to create an environment conducive to scientific innovation and talent development. Through in-depth analysis, researchers can better understand the actual effects of these programs and provide strong support for future policy-making.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>3. Talent Flow</h3>
                                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                                        Among the applicants for the first four batches of the YTT program, a total of 721 met the requirements. Our main analysis excluded 309 individuals because they either returned to China for non-academic work (27), obtained their PhD in China (196), were not of Chinese descent (34), left China within five years of returning (5), or lacked resume information (47). Thus, we are left with 339 returnees who obtained their PhD abroad, accepted the invitation, and conducted research in China for at least five years.
                                        <br>&emsp; As shown in the map below, returnees are mainly concentrated in Beijing (101), Shanghai (49), and Hefei (36). Returnees are also concentrated at the University of Science and Technology of China (34), Peking University (28), Tsinghua University (28), and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (21).
                                        <br>&emsp; The distribution of returnees in China shows obvious geographic concentration, mainly in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hefei. Returnees tend to cluster in top higher education institutions, especially "985" universities, such as the University of Science and Technology of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
                                        <br>&emsp; Beijing and Shanghai, with many top universities and research institutions, may have become China's centers for research and innovation. The research environment in these cities is more open and collaborative, which is conducive to innovation and knowledge exchange among returnees. As international metropolises, Beijing and Shanghai have high international visibility and attractiveness, while Hefei, home to the University of Science and Technology of China, attracts many returnees due to the university's outstanding performance in research.
                                        <br>&emsp; The data also indicates a trend in talent mobility: returnees are more likely to choose cities that offer better career development opportunities and quality of life. For other cities, attracting and retaining returnees may require improving their research environment, educational resources, quality of life, and level of internationalization, as well as formulating targeted talent introduction and retention policies.
